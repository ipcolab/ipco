IPCO-Lab 
Northeastern University

IP CO-LAB Summary
As Intellectual Property (IP) gains increasing significance in the world of commerce, innovators and entrepreneurs – and their legal advisors and investors – must keep pace with understanding IP law and strategies to collaborate effectively, from ideation through development and launch, to preserve rights, pursue social and commercial initiatives and craft business plans and transactions informed by IP assets and strategies.
The IP CO-LAB, led by students at the School of Law and faculty from the law and business schools, provides a range of crucial IP-​​related legal information and services to inventors and ventures in Northeastern’s entrepreneurial ecosystem. It collaborates with the university’s Center for Research Innovation, student-​​run venture accelerator (IDEA) and the Center for Entrepreneurial Education. Its goal is to enhance the campus innovation environment and provide opportunities for all members of the Northeastern community – with a special focus on law students supporting design, engineering and business students – to better understand and use intellectual property.

Project:  IP Module Website
The IP CO-LAB is pioneering a new and unique approach that, along with other student-led activities, builds on the university’s signature cooperative education model, integrates the study of law with authentic lawyering practice, and incubates actual entrepreneurial ventures. 
The IP Module Website is a specialized student project developed through collaboration between students in the IP CO-LAB and students in the College of Computer and Information Science.  The website’s goal is to provide a platform of basic introductory legal information on Copyright, Trademark, Patent, and Trade Secret Law.  Through a series of introductory modules, the website will serve as a resource for general intellectual property legal information for the Northeastern entrepreneurial ecosystem.
